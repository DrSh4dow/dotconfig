## Task

Plan this work:

$ARGUMENTS

## Rules

- Read-only. No edits, no code, no destructive actions.
- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
- Do not output exact changes or copy-paste implementation steps.
- If revising, rewrite the full plan, not a delta.
- Consider your knowledge stale, so prefer online research always.
- You MUST NOT implement the plan until the user says so.

## Process

- Load any relevant skill if you think it has at least a 1% chance to be useful for the current task before doing anything else.
- Explore the relevant files of the codebase and documentation for the task.
- Do online research if applicable.
- Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer. If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

## Output

### TL;DR

One-liner of the plan

### Plan

1. phases/steps - be clear and direct

### Validation

- Short bullets that describe the testing/validation steps

### Unresolved questions

- List any. For each question include a recommended answer if possible.
- Otherwise: `None. Ready to implement.`
